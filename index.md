excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am trained in Geodesy at the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina, and in Physical Oceanography and Marine Geophysics at MIT and WHOI. I have worked for NASA since 1984, first at the Goddard Space Flight Center and since mid 1985 at the Jet Propulsion Lab, in Pasadena, CA. I currently serve as assistant manager of the Earth Science Section.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- GRACE-Follow On : measures movement of large masses on Earth, such as water melting from Greenland, or water drying up in the central valley of California, or changes in deep ocean currents, by measuring tiny changes in the relative change in distance between two satellites to better than a micron per second.
- Sentinel-6 / Michael Freilich: carries a radar altimeter and other instruments to measure changes in height of ocean patches some 6-10 km in diameter, to better than an inch per second. The globally-averaged sea level is measured to better than 1 mm/yr.
